# ðŸš„ Railway Deployment Guide for JufipAI Website

## Quick Setup Steps (5 minutes total)

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. You should see your existing n8n project
3. Click "New Project" or the "+" button

### Step 2: Create New Service
1. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Choose "perdomonestor01-hue/jufipai-website"
3. Click "Deploy Now"

### Step 3: Configure Deployment Settings
Railway will auto-detect the configuration from our files, but verify:

**Build Settings:**
- âœ… Build Command: `echo 'Static site - no build needed'`
- âœ… Start Command: `npm start`
- âœ… Root Directory: `/` (default)

**Environment:**
- âœ… PORT: (Auto-set by Railway)
- âœ… NODE_ENV: `production`

### Step 4: First Deployment Test
1. Railway will automatically deploy (takes 30-60 seconds)
2. You'll get a URL like: `https://jufipai-website-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
3. Test this URL to verify everything works
4. **Check for Articles section** - should load immediately!

### Step 5: Configure Custom Domain
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your jufipai-website service
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Click "Custom Domain"
4. Add: `jufipai.com`
5. Railway will provide CNAME record

### Step 6: Update DNS (at your domain provider)
1. Go to your DNS provider (where you manage jufipai.com)
2. Update the CNAME record to point to Railway's provided domain
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation

### Step 7: SSL Certificate
- Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates
- Your site will be available at `https://jufipai.com`
- This usually takes 2-5 minutes after DNS propagation

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Results

## ðŸ”§ Future Deployments

Once set up, future updates are automatic:
